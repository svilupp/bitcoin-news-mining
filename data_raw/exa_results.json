      "content": "Around the world, governments everywhere are trying to come to terms with technology. Some are finding the pace of change too fast and the flow of information too free for their autocratic hierarchies, and they risk being swept away. \n \n \n In the US and the UK, attempts to generate efficiencies and drive wider social benefits from digital technology have delivered uneven results. There is tension between the proponents of technology-driven change and those who seek to uphold long-established legal, economic and social structures, as witnessed in the arguments over intellectual property between the tech giants and the creative industries, and the heated debate over the surveillance of electronic communications. It is clear that policymakers and those who advise them do not have a satisfactory conceptual framework for dealing with the disruptive impact of technology on society. \n \n \n At the G8 meeting in Northern Ireland last week, the focus was on three Ts: Trade, Tax and Transparency. The aim was to boost the global economy while responding to popular concern about the ways in which large corporations and wealthy individuals have used technology-driven globalisation to minimise taxes. This is an important agenda for taxpayers, and progress is being made. \n \n \n Largely unnoticed, an interesting advert appeared in a handbook accompanying the G8, placed by a company that was until recently known only to a small number of technology entrepreneurs and early adopters. The advertiser was Mt Gox, a marketplace for trading BitCoin, a digital currency. The message was that with more than 7,500 legitimate businesses using a single BitCoin payment processor (BitPay), digital currencies have arrived, and existing currencies and regulators had better take note. And so they should, because the technology that powers digital currencies like BitCoin presents a challenge to those, such as the G8 governments, currently exercising sovereignty over our societies. \n \n \n BitCoin itself is a peer-to-peer digital currency which, unlike the currencies found in virtual worlds such as Second Life\u2019s \"Linden Dollars\", can be used to purchase real-world as well as online goods and services. The people who created BitCoin remain something of a mystery, but its innovative peer-to-peer structure and the sophistication of its code has helped establish it as the leader in this field. \n \n \n BitCoins are \"mined\" by peers in the BitCoin network, who apply computing power to solve complex mathematical problems. This work also serves to authenticate and record every transaction made in or with BitCoin, avoiding the need for any central regulator or clearing house. Once mined, the BitCoins can be stored in a digital wallet on a laptop or smartphone, and then used to buy goods or services from anyone willing to accept digital currency, or traded for other currencies via exchanges such as Mt Gox. \n \n \n Alternative currencies are, of course, nothing new. Many Londoners carry an Oyster Card, which they load with traditional currency and then exchange for travel. A plethora of digital currencies now exist, some used by online gamers within communities like World of Warcraft ; others on mainstream e-commerce platforms such as Amazon. The total value of the virtual currency in circulation is increasing rapidly, with BitCoin alone valued in excess of $1bn. \n \n \n BitCoin has risen to prominence this year in part thanks to the spike, crash and subsequent recovery in its value. This rollercoaster, plus the suggestion that its primary function is to facilitate criminal activity, has piqued the interest of both the mainstream media, regulators and law enforcement authorities. \n \n \n Technology is reinventing finance. For the individual, there is a widening array of options for receiving, holding, transferring and spending the money that we earn; likewise, for governments, there are opportunities to reduce costs, simplify processes, and engage with citizens. In the developing world, value transfer via SMS is already replacing cash. With virtual currencies like BitCoin now operable without the need for a bank account, why would you open one? We need to ask whether the 5bn people coming online in the next five years will want to use our conventional financial tools and systems. We have hardly made a persuasive case for them in recent years. \n \n \n This phenomenon is part of a wider trend towards networked and globalised power structures that tend to undermine the nation state-based systems to which we have grown accustomed. Last week, the world\u2019s most powerful nations grappled with the complexity of a global tax system. But almost unnoticed, the rise of digital currencies like BitCoin threatens to render obsolete even the modest progress made by the G8. BitCoin's distributed network structure makes it hard for any one country or group of countries to regulate its activities. This is one of the currency\u2019s main appeals for some early users, and it is only a matter of time before larger players begin to exploit the opportunities presented by immediate and secure value transfer, delivered anonymously and at next-to-zero cost. \n \n \n Mainstream adoption ought, in our view, to come about via an accommodation between the new currencies and the old regulators, just as the offshore financial centres are making concessions on tax transparency and company ownership. If states remain disengaged from these digital currencies, who will protect their citizens in cases of fraud or hacking, the unfortunate but inevitable corollary of any virtual product? \n \n \n To tackle such serious threats there is no realistic alternative to the international system of sovereign states that continues to police international peace and security, but which may not be well-adapted to the globalised digital age. \n \n \n Unless the issues that BitCoin raises are addressed in a thoughtful and proactive manner by existing authorities, the disintermediating power of technology is likely to have a disruptive impact on currency systems and those that regulate and rely on them. And the effect could be as significant for governments as the rise of social media has been for individuals. \n \n \n Alec Ross is a former senior adviser on innovation to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton; Jonathan Luff is a former international affairs adviser to Prime Minister David Cameron",

Soon however, the coins were worth 20 times what he had paid for them and he decided to see if he could entice in other like minded Bitcoin holders into his hostelry.

While Bitcoins were first introduced and were initially unknown to everyone but hackers and the computer-savvy, they soon caught the eye of investors. BITCOINS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW The Bitcoin operates as a two way currency which can be exchanged for dollars and vice versa. The notion behind it is to facilitate cheap, anonymous transactions policed by its community of users and is built around trust rather than relying on institutions like governments or banks. Bitcoin's status as a digital currency is debatable, it is entirely a digital product but is not regulated and it has a limit of 21million, which is predicted to last until 2140. The finite nature of Bitcoins means it performs more like a commodity, such as gold. Bitcoin first emerged in 2008 and launched as a network in 2009. It was created by an obscure hacker whose identity is a mystery but is known as Satoshi Nakamoto, which is thought to be a pseudonym for the person or group who created it. Each Bitcoin is a piece of computer code that has been generated through very slow computer processing, also known as 'mining'. Users choose a virtual wallet from one of the various providers which enables them to receive, give and trade coins from other users. Bitcoin's can be bought from specialist online currency exchanges and online marketplaces such as ebay. Users can send money directly from their computers to others on the other side of the world, and coins can be used to buy real goods, swapped for cash on exchanges or used for speculation.

Mr Early, a former computer scientist, created and installed a Bitcoin payment option at his pubs and registered it on a database of Bitcoin retailers. Those wanting to pay via Bitcoin at his pubs can do so quickly and effectively. Staff press two buttons on a till for it to reveal a QR code. The customer uses their Bitcoin wallet app on their phone or computer and takes a picture of the screen to confirm the payment. With one more push of the button from the bar staff the process is complete. Mr Early said he has already had about \u00a3800 worth of transaction from Bitcoin users, and though he admits there is a certain novelty value, he said: 'It's more than I expected it to be. 'I really didn't expect that wave of enthusiasm and people coming in to try it out.' The Pembury Tavern is the first UK pub to go Bitcoin-friendly, but other high profile businesses and purchases have been made with the currency.",

      "content": "The US Drug Enforcement Administration has posted an official notice stating that it seized bitcoins from an individual for purchasing a controlled substance. According to Let's Talk Bitcoin , this may, in fact, be the first time a law enforcement agency has seized bitcoins. The DEA notice shows that, among many other people, a Mr. Eric Daniel Hughes (AKA Casey Jones) had 11.02BTC, with a value of $814.22 USD, on April 12th, earlier this year. The digital money was taken in forfeiture as the individual was in violation of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 801 et seq.), in the district of South Carolina. The notice is a general release, detailing all of the forfeitures by US citizens in violation of the Controlled Substances Act, of which Mr Hughes is one of many. As such, there are no details in the notice as to how the bitcoins were actually seized. However, Let's Talk Bitcoin say: There is no indication the Bitcoin protocol was compromised. \u2018\u201cSeizure\u201d is probably a word used to imply that money was received in the process of a Silk Road sting operation, rather than actually seized from the bitcoin user\u2019s wallet. \u201d said Andreas M. Antonopoulos, a security expert and Let\u2019s Talk Bitcoin contributor. The bitcoin address referenced in the notice, 1ETDwGUC1QcjYuehFr3u1FD3MvDaUs7SFy , can be seen on the blockchain receiving 11.02 BTC on April 12th 2013, which matches the DEA notice. The blockchain also shows the same bitcoin address that paid the 11.02 BTC had remaining funds of 33.580606 BTC that were transferred into a change address . Mr Hughes then went onto spend another 1.7 BTC on the same day. blockchain-anony The receiving address , cited in the DEA notice, transferred the 11.02 BTC out five days later, and on the 22nd of May received a further 17.24 BTC, which was then sent onto another address which was subsequently combined into a 200 BTC block, effectively anonymizing further transactions.",

      "content": "California's Department of Financial Institutions is going after Bitcoin. Today, Forbes published a cease and desist letter sent to the Bitcoin Foundation, an organization devoted to creating best practices for the decentralized currency. Regulators accused the foundation of being \"engaged in the business of money transmission\" without license or authorization under California's Financial Code. If it doesn't comply with the order, it faces a fine of $1,000 to $2,500 per day or per transmission.

We've reached out to the Bitcoin Foundation about the order, so we'll hopefully soon have more information about what California's bank regulators are looking to stop. It's also possible that this is part of a larger crackdown on Bitcoin by California, in which case other trading floors or companies would have received similar notices.

      "content": "California regulators recently warned a nonprofit organization related to the online \"crypto-currency\" Bitcoin that it may face charges for unlicensed money transmission. Misunderstanding may lie at the core of the warning, but the bleeding-edge experimental money has seen no end of legal troubles since it started becoming more well-known. In 2010, a Bitcoin user paid 10,000 Bitcoins for a pizza \u2014 no doubt a gag purchase made with what were at the time essentially worthless online tokens. Today, those Bitcoins would be worth over $1 million. A sudden jump in value like that results in as many problems as opportunities. Bitcoin now struggles for legitimacy in the eyes of the law \u2014 the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission is considering whether the virtual currency should be subject to its rules \u2014 while trying to build consumers' trust that it can scale to accommodate a global community. The explosive growth of Mt. Gox, the largest Bitcoin \"exchange\" where users store and trade the currency, has led in the past few weeks to major downtime, hacker attacks and legal trouble. Other exchanges and services have simply shut down or gone out of business when faced with the unexpected liability and legal requirements of handling assets suddenly worth potentially millions of dollars. The latest wave of bad news hit the Bitcoin Foundation, a nonprofit organization that promotes and invests in Bitcoin services and companies. Jon Matonis, who sits on its board of directors, wrote in Forbes that he received a warning letter from California's Department of Financial Institutions accusing the foundation of unlicensed money transmission, a felony charge that could result in hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines. Both Matonis and the Department of Financial Institutions declined to comment further on specifics. But Matonis wrote in an email to NBC News that the foundation is definitely not engaged in money transmission, and he viewed the case as \"an opportunity to educate state regulators on issues related to the bitcoin industry.\" Whatever happens with Bitcoin, it seems education is needed. \"It's like the early days of the Internet,\" Tony Gallippi, CEO of Bitcoin-handling company BitPay, told NBC News recently. \"Everything that's happened so far has been a learning experience.\" Bart Chilton, head of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission financial regulatory body, also thinks it's important to investigate new technologies early on. \"I don't think we need to regulate everything,\" he told NBC News last month. \"But we need to be more proactive in looking into things. It would be irresponsible of us not to look into it.\" Six months ago, Bitcoin lacked visibility. Not only are the concept and inner workings too complex for the average Internet user to understand, but there wasn't really a reason to try. Unless they planned on buying drugs on the shady, anonymous \"Silk Road\" online store, there wasn't much a normal consumer could do with the currency. It must have been a surprise for the users of this obscure system, then, when mainstream news media suddenly began covering the currency. The small community was thrust into the limelight, whether they liked it or not. Bitcoin made for a great story: operating entirely online, near-impossible to game, with a seedy past and a mysterious genius of a creator. (Speculation is still rampant on the identity of the inventor, who goes by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.) But as we're finding out, it still has a ways to go before it can be a great tool. The old, informal methods of using Bitcoin are dying out: Of the two largest \"exchanges\" where Bitcoins are bought and sold, one, Bitfloor, shut down in April following a major theft, and the other, Mt. Gox, is facing potential criminal charges after failing to properly disclose its financial practices to FinCEN, a U.S. regulatory body. FinCEN recently acknowledged \"decentralized virtual currencies\" like Bitcoin as being real money, prompting scrutiny of their systems and investment. New firms are learning from predecessors, working with regulators and established financial players from the get-go, and structuring themselves in order to handle large amounts of money without meltdowns. Gallippi's BitPay is a relative newcomer that aims to use Bitcoin for serious, legal businesses, and the Winklevoss twins \u2014 of Facebook and \"Social Network\" movie fame \u2014 have launched a new exchange called BitInstant. \"Price increases tend to bring increased awareness, and then after the price volatility settles a bit, the ecosystem is left with the infrastructure builders,\" Jon Matonis wrote in an earlier email to NBC News. \"It's a good thing,\" he said. Gallippi, too, sees optimism with the maturing of the system. \"Today, when you use the Internet, do you talk about IP addresses? Do you talk about HTTP, TCP/IP?\" asked Gallippi. The nitty-gritty details of Bitcoin \"mining,\" day-to-day price fluctuations, and yes, the occasional scam, shouldn't matter to users. For illustration, he alluded to the dollar: Do you worry about its strength versus the yen, or about the effect of counterfeiting and minting? Regulation and oversight, too, will ultimately result in a stronger ecosystem, both Gallippi and Matonis suggested, but things need time to catch up. As Gallippi put it: \"You can't apply the rules for the horse and buggy to an automobile.\" Devin Coldewey is a contributing writer for NBC News Digital. His personal website is coldewey.cc .",

      "content": "I got lots of flak from the Bitcoin community when I suggested a currency peg to ease the transition for universal acceptance of bitcoin. \nFrom the current price of around $100 to an interim target\nof $1,000, where it will achieve a market capitalization of\napproximately $15 bn., and a level where more sophisticated\ninstitutional products can be created, guidance on pricing needs\nto come from outside the bitcoin\nprotocol.\n \nThe outcry heard from Bitcoiners is that any price peg\ndestroys what Bitcoin stands for. This is untrue, but it sounds\nnice. Just like stakes are used to support young trees as they\ngrow to keep them growing straight, Bitcoin needs similar support\nat this stage of its development. The Bitcoin protocol, as\ningenious as it is, is a mining protocol, not a pricing protocol.\nThis bit of the project was left hanging when Bitcoin was\nintroduced and the community was left to deal with it as best it\ncan.\n \nBitPay, one of the pillars of the Bitcoin community (full\ndisclosure: I am an investor in this company) has now switched\nfrom using MtGox (the largest Bitcoin exchange, handling\napproximately 75% of all Bitcoin trades) for pricing their\nmerchant transactions - - to a new index-like composite\nprice.\n \nAs I\u2019ve said in previous blogs, the exchange piece in the\nbitcoin econo-metric ecosystem is the weakest link; it results in\nmonopoly-pricing that precludes sufficient competition in the\nmarket to generate worthwhile price discovery.\n \nMaintaining a peg (or something like it), as such, as I\nwrote about earlier; is an interim solution to get around the\n\u2018 MtGox problem.\u2019 And implementation of said peg; like\nBitcoin itself, can be original in design, but with results equal\nto a more traditional currency peg.\n \nIn other words, when I described the peg idea I pointed to\nthe Bitcoin Foundation as a potential body to capitalize and\nmaintain the bitcoin peg. My point was that the Bitcoin\nFoundation could be the oversight group to organize a price\nquote, but capitalizing and maintaining the \u2018official\u2019 BTC\nprice does not necessarily mean putting up equal, (or significant\npartial amounts) relative to to the current float of BTC\n(approximately $1.4 bn.). It can mean doing what BitPay is doing;\ncreating an indexed price; offering guidance for transactions\nthat in turn boost confidence in price discovery which in turn\nincrease liquidity and market capitalization.So far, so\ngood.\n \nThe new price guidance effort is a good step in the right\ndirection for Bitcoin. It\u2019s something I predicted would be\nnecessary given the fact that the Bitcoin protocol is a mining\nprotocol and not a pricing protocol.\n \nAs the market capitalization of Bitcoin climbs into the\n10\u2019s and 100\u2019s of billions of dollars - drawing in more\ninstitutional players along with its ascent, (a virtual guarantee\nnow that the global banking system appears to be on the verge of\nanother round of bailouts and money printing), another step\ntoward another variation on the peg theme a peg will probably\ntake shape. Will it be something closer to a traditional peg?\nProbably not, but that model still serves as a handy\nguide.\n \nBitcoin is our (i.e., the community of hacktivists who\nfight centralized, monopoly politics and economics) baby. We\nwilled it into existence as counterpart to our complete\ndissatisfaction (and horror) at what the global banking\n(organized theft) system has become; a system of crony\nkleptocrats printing gads of cash for pet projects and wars\ndestroying civil society and the environment while simultaneously\ninflating the cost of basic goods and services.\n \nWe\u2019ll get to the goal of frictionless, math-based,\ncryptocurrency that redefines money in the end. All that\u2019s needed\nis a little patience, some solid price discovery.\n The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.

      "content": "Added \n28 June, 2013 \n \n \n \n Bitcoin is getting another real-life boost at the Pembury Tavern in Hackney, east London, as well as its sister pubs in Cambridge, Norwich and Peterborough, all of which are now accepting the virtual currency. Pub founder Stephen Early, a former computer scientist, created a Bitcoin payment system that is now in use at the pubs. The bar staff press two buttons on the till and the screen displays a QR code. The customer opens their digital Bitcoin wallet, takes a snap of the screen and confirms the payment. The staff press one more button and the transaction is complete. The Pembury Tavern is the first UK pub to go Bitcoin-friendly but not the first real-world business. In the Kreuzberg district of Berlin, restaurants, bars and a record shop have been using the payment system for months. In Ireland, just outside the small town of Birr, Bitcoin users can now book a night at a farmhouse bed and breakfast. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 60 trends spotted \n 172 trends loved \n \n \nMore trends spotted by M.C Mooch : \n \n \n \n You might also love these \n \n \n Recently loved by",
