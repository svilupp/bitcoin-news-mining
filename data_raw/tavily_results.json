      "content": "Cryptocurrencies To Watch: Week of June 12\n\nAlice Morgan / Investopedia\n\nKeep an Eye on These Coins\n\nThe crypto market took a huge hit last week, largely due to the lawsuits that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed against crypto giants Binance and Coinbase. This caused the market to lose billions in market cap, and it\u2019s unclear how the events will unfold and what further impact they will have. Most coins are in the red, with a select few being only slightly affected.\n\nThis week, we examine PAX Gold (PAXG), XRP (XRP), Bitcoin (BTC), Monero (XMR), and Gnosis (GNO). In selecting these assets, we have considered several factors, including, but not limited to, positive technical developments, significant news events, and noticeable changes in price.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nPAX Gold (PAXG)\n\nPAX Gold (PAXG) is a cryptocurrency backed by gold and was created by those behind Paxos Standard. PAXG may be seeing less of an impact from the effects of the SEC\u2019s lawsuits because it is a token that aims to make gold easier to trade.\n\nGold is often used as a reserve asset during volatile periods, and this may be working to its benefit. PAXG is trading at around $1,924, having been priced at $1,944 last week (see chart below).\n\nPAXG Price: TradingView\n\nXRP (XRP)\n\nRipple Lab's XRP, is actually doing well in this volatile time because it won the motion to unseal the Hinman documents in its case against the SEC.\n\nThe documents in question contain statements made by former SEC member Bill Hinman, who stated that Ether was not a security. XRP is currently changing hands at around $0.52, having traded at $0.53 last week (see chart below).\n\nXRP Price: TradingView\n\nBitcoin (BTC)\n\nBitcoin (BTC) was one of the strongest currencies in the market this week. When investors move out of altcoins during a bearish period, they tend to put their funds into stablecoins or Bitcoin. This is possibly why the market\u2019s most popular asset saw a relatively small decline.\n\nBTC is currently priced at around $25,985, having been valued at $26,760 last week (see chart below).\n\nBTC Price: TradingView\n\nMonero (XMR)\n\nMonero (XMR) is similar to Bitcoin in that it has a strong community that backs it during troubling periods. Specifically, ardent crypto enthusiasts appreciate Monero\u2019s high level of privacy.\n\nThe crypto community utilizes crypto assets like XMR at a time when the market is rough, and it seems like there may be regulatory pressure. XMR is trading at around $139.00, having started last week at $145.96 (see chart below).\n\nXMR Price: TradingView\n\nGnosis (GNO)\n\nGnosis (GNO) is something of a surprise entrant on this list, given that it has not performed as well as some other tokens in recent weeks. However, it may be staving off the effects of volatility. This is due to the fact that real-world tokenization project Backed Finance announced its intention to expand its native token issuance to the Gnosis Chain.\n\nGNO is trading at around $109.80, having been priced at $115.30 last week (see chart below).\n\nGNO Price: TradingView\n\nAs of the date this article was written, the author does not own any of the assets discussed here.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.

The email describes an \u201celectronic cash system that\u2019s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.\u201d\nYou can find the full message here, and an excerpt is pictured below.\nThe email linked to a whitepaper called \u201cBitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.\"\nThe whitepaper describes Bitcoin as \u201can electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party.\u201d\nSatoshi included a description of how transactions would work as follows:\n\u201cEach owner transfers the coin to the next by digitally signing a hash of the previous transaction and the public key of the next owner and adding these to the end of the coin. A payee can verify the signatures to verify the chain of ownership.\u201d\nSatoshi also included a description of Bitcoin\u2019s proof of work system, pictured below.\nBitcoin\u2019s PoW was inspired by the Hashcash system designed by Adam Back in 1997, which Back designed as denial of service counter measure.\nDecember 12, 2008, BTC Price: $0 \u2013 Bitcoin is added to open-source community resource Sourceforge. There are a number of interesting exchanges about how Bitcoin could one day be used between the earliest developers and contributors.\nThere are several messages from Hal Finney, a fellow software developer, alerting Satoshi to some bugs in Bitcoin\u2019s initial code.\nYou can find a now infamous post by Finney discussing Bitcoin\u2019s value potential should it become the dominant payment system worldwide, pictured below.\nJanuary 3, 2009, BTC Price: $0 \u2013 The Bitcoin blockchain launches, and the genesis block is mined. The block famously included the title of a Times article title \u201cChancellor on brink of second bailout for banks,\u201d pictured below.\nThis note from Satoshi gave rise to the popular theory today \u2014 namely, that Bitcoin was created as a direct response to the unethical and irresponsible behavior of the traditional banking sector in the run up to the 2008 crash. The total supply of Bitcoin is fixed, with the number of Bitcoins capped at 21 million. Fractions of Bitcoin are called \"Satoshis\" aptly named after the founder and representing 0.00000001 BTC.\nJanuary 8, 2009, BTC Price: $0 - Bitcoin v0.1 released. Satoshi describes Bitcoin as \u201ca new electronic cash system that uses a peer-to-peer network to prevent double-spending. It's completely decentralized with no server or central authority.\u201d\nJanuary 12, 2009, BTC Price: $0 \u2013 The first Bitcoin transaction for 10 BTC takes place between Satoshi and Hal Finney.\nBy this point, Finney was extremely active in the early Bitcoin space. The computer scientist is credited with creating the first ever reusable PoW system, and was one of the earliest responders to Satoshi\u2019s initial posts, helping fix some early bugs.\nFinney, pictured below, is believed to be the second person to run the Bitcoin network after Satoshi.\nSadly, Finney was diagnosed with ALS in 2009, which led to him spending his final years confined to a wheelchair. Finney shared the news of his diagnosis in a blog post.\nDespite his diagnosis and resulting paralysis, Finney remained upbeat. In a 2013 blog post, he writes \u201cIt has been an adjustment, but my life is not too bad\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m pretty lucky overall. Even with the ALS, my life is very satisfying.\u201d\nDuring his final years, Finney continued writing code using an eye-tracker system.\nFebruary 11, 2009, BTC Price: $0 - Satoshi Nakamoto posts some information about Bitcoin on the P2P Foundation forum.\nHe writes, \u201cI\u2019ve developed a new open-source P2P e-cash system called Bitcoin. It\u2019s completely decentralized, with no central server or trusted parties, because everything is based on crypto proof instead of trust.\u201d\nSatoshi\u2019s description of the problem solved by Bitcoin is pictured below.\nApril 12, 2009, BTC Price: $0 \u2013 Satoshi begins emailing back and forth with Mike Hearn, a developer at Google who later worked full time on Bitcoin\u2019s development. They discussed mining, transaction speed and size, security and more.\nOctober 12, 2009, BTC Price: $0 \u2013A Finnish developer called Martti Malmi, also known as Sirius, sells 5,050 Bitcoin for $5.02, giving Bitcoin its first price in USD of $0.0009.\nJanuary 24, 2010, BTC Price: $0 \u2013 A user by the name of Sabunir posts on the Bitcointalk Forum trying to sell a picture for 500 Bitcoin.\nThis thread includes some interesting back and forth between the first ever Bitcoin users and Satoshi, including an explanation as to why Bitcoin transactions can\u2019t contain encrypted messages.\nFebruary 15, 2010, BTC Price: $0 \u2013 In a response to some negative feedback on his post on the P2P Foundation site, Satoshi explains why previous attempts at creating a peer-to-peer digital currency failed:\n\u201cA lot of people automatically dismiss e-currency as a lost cause because of all the companies that failed since the 1990's. I hope it's obvious it was only the centrally controlled nature of those systems that doomed them. I think this is the first time we're trying a decentralized, non-trust-based system.\u201d\nFebruary 26, 2010, BTC Price: $0 \u2013 Satoshi asks for feedback on a Bitcoin logo which includes the now iconic \u201ctwo lines through the outside.\u201d\nMay 22, 2010, BTC Price: $0 - A man called Laszlo negotiated with another early Bitcoin enthusiast to have two Papa John\u2019s pizzas, pictured below, delivered to his home in exchange for 10,000 Bitcoins.\nAt this point, there was no \u201cofficial\u201d or established method for buying and selling goods and services with Bitcoin, and no exchanges, so trading Bitcoin for goods and services usually required some bartering over the internet.\nThanks to Lazlo, Bitcoin fans fondly refer to May 22 as Bitcoin Pizza Day.\nThe 10,000 Bitcoins Lazlo paid for the two pizzas currently have a value of more than $600 million \u2014 today, that could buy you 10,000 metric tons of real gold.\nIt\u2019s not much consolation, but at least Lazlo has the bragging rights for eating the most expensive meal in the history of our species.\nJune 11, 2010, BTC Price: $0 \u2013 Software developer Gavin Andresen launches a now legendary project on Bitcointalk called The Bitcoin Faucet. The Bitcoin faucet gave away free Bitcoins to help the network get off the ground.\nAndresen received significant praise for his project, including from Satoshi himself, whose reply is pictured below.\nFrom 2010 onwards, Andresen was Bitcoin\u2019s chief developer. MIT Technology review even described Andresen as \u201cThe Man Who Really Built Bitcoin.\u201d\nJuly, 2010, BTC First Price: $0.08 \u2013 Bitcoin starts trading at an estimated price of $0.0008 to $0.08 per coin.\nAugust 6, 2010, BTC Price: $0.08 \u2013 A Bitcointalk member by the name of \u201cgridecon\u201d shares some concerns about Bitcoin\u2019s energy usage in a post titled \u201cBitcoin minting is thermodynamically perverse.\u201d\nAn excerpt from the post is pictured below.\nIn response to the post, Satoshi compares mining Bitcoin to mining gold, \u201cthe marginal cost of gold mining tends to stay near the price of gold. Gold mining is a waste, but that waste is far less than the utility of having gold available as a medium of exchange.\u201d\nHe continues, \u201cthe utility of the exchanges made possible by Bitcoin will far exceed the cost of electricity used. Therefore, not having Bitcoin would be the net waste.\u201d\nIn a post on August 9, Satoshi added \u201cBitcoin generation should end up where it's cheapest. Maybe that will be in cold climates where there's electric heat, where it would be essentially free.\u201d\nThis prediction did come true. Some estimates suggest 75% of the energy currently used for Bitcoin mining comes from renewable sources.\nHowever, this number will likely drop quite soon due to China\u2019s recent regulatory crackdown on Bitcoin, so many miners (the majority of which were based in China) will have to relocate to countries with less access to renewable power.\nJuly 31, 2010, BTC Price: $0.08 \u2013 Bitcoin\u2019s Wikipedia page was deleted. This might have caused dismay, but Bitcoin\u2019s early fans maintained a sense of humor. A user going by the name \u201cfresno\u201d responded \u201cWiki-who? Never heard of it! Is it some sort of Ukulele band?\u201d\nAnother user added, \u201cthe admin who deleted the article is an expert on glaciers. Does this make him an ice-hole?\u201d\nSatoshi\u2019s response is pictured below.\nAugust 15, 2010, BTC Price: $0.08 \u2013 184 billion Bitcoins were created in a fraudulent transaction by exploiting a vulnerability in the Bitcoin protocol. The transaction was quickly seen and removed from the blockchain. The network then forked to an updated version without the fraudulent transaction.\nSatoshi posted a message on Sourceforge warning users not to trust transactions after the hack occurred, pictured below.\nTo date, this was arguably the most serious direct breach of the Bitcoin network.\nDecember 10, 2010, BTC Price: $0.50 \u2013 PC World shares an article describing Bitcoin as \u201ca decentralized virtual currency that could either be the best idea since they figured out how to slice bread, or just another hacker\u2019s daydream.\u201d\nThe article suggested that the Wikileaks scandal led to the creation of Bitcoin, which isn\u2019t correct.\nSatoshi responded to the article being shared on the Bitcointalk forums the following day, writing, \u201cit would have been nice to get this attention in any other context. WikiLeaks has kicked the hornet's nest, and the swarm is headed towards us.\u201d\nWhile the article didn\u2019t provide Bitcoin with positive press, it had a profound impact on spreading the word about the Satoshi\u2019s creation.\nDecember 12, 2010, BTC Price: $0.50 \u2013 Satoshi posts his final message on the Bitcointalk.org forum, pictured below.\n2011 \u2013 2014\nApril 26, 2011, BTC Price: $1.00 \u2013 Satoshi\u2019s final confirmed correspondence, which was an email to Gavin Andresen, pictured below.\nJune 2011, BTC Price: $31 \u2013 BTC\u2019s price surges to $31 before crashing back down to below $10, marking the first Bitcoin bubble.\nIn July, the NYT reports that Bitcoin\u2019s price crash was caused by a number of hacking incidents on the earliest Bitcoin exchanges.\nOctober 2011, BTC Price: $3.27 \u2013 Often described as \"Bitcoin Lite,\" Litecoin (LTC) was designed to enable instant, peer-to-peer exchange at affordable rates. Litecoin is one of the first few crypto projects and was created by Charlie Lee, a Google employee and director of engineering at Coinbase later on. Litecoin can be considered altcoins \u2014 cryptocurrencies created after Bitcoin.\nMarch 2012, BTC Price: $4.89 \u2013 A cloud computing and website hosting platform called Linode is hacked.\nAccording to theregister.com, 43,554 BTC were stolen, many of which belonged to Gavin Andresen. At the time, Andresen was Bitcoin\u2019s lead developer, so this breach was a particularly embarrassing setback for the Bitcoin dev team.\nMay 12, 2012, BTC Price: $4.95 \u2013 Bitcoinica, an early Bitcoin exchange, gained widespread media attention due to a recent security breach in which more than 18,000 Bitcoins were stolen.\nThe exchange, facing numerous million dollars in lawsuits, decided to shut down.\nAugust 17, 2012, BTC Price: $12.51 \u2013 The WSJ reports than Trendon Shavers had been arrested for running a Bitcoin Ponzi scheme that at one point accounted for 7% of the total Bitcoin supply.\nShavers was eventually sentenced to 18 months in prison and faced heavy fines as well as a $40 million civil action.\nSeptember 22, 2012, BTC Price: $12.26 \u2013 Gavin Andresen launches the Bitcoin Foundation \u2014 a non-profit aiming to accelerate Bitcoin\u2019s growth. The launch received quite a bit of mainstream media attention, including from Forbes.\nNovember 15, 2012, BTC Price: $11.09 - WordPress announces it has partnered with BitPay to allow its customers to pay for upgrades with Bitcoin.\nThis was the first time a recognized, global company had agreed to accept Bitcoin as payment for its services.\nNovember 28, 2012, BTC Price: $12.27 \u2013 The first subsidy halving occurs. From block 210,000 onward, the mining reward is halved from 50 BTC to 25 BTC.\nFebruary 25, 2013, BTC Price: $30.14 \u2013 Mike Hearn, one of Bitcoin\u2019s early developers, reveals on a Bitcointalk forum post that Satoshi informed him and a few other developers, including Gavin Andresen, of his plan to leave the Bitcoin project to focus on \u201cother things.\u201d\nHearn\u2019s message on Bitcointalk.org is pictured below.\nMarch 11, 2013, BTC Price: $47.20 \u2013 The Bitcoin network suffers a terrifying setback.\nA second Bitcoin blockchain was created that ran in parallel with the true version. Each blockchain had its own distinct transaction ledger.\nBitcoin trading was immediately stopped so that developers could find and fix the bug. An updated version including a patch to prevent the bug causing the same problem again was released in just six hours.\nTwo days later, Vitalik Buterin released an article on Bitcoinmagazine.com describing what had happened.\nThis bug shook the confidence of many Bitcoin users \u2014 yet many still consider the speed and accuracy of the fix to be a remarkable achievement by the development team and wider community.\nApril 1, 2013, BTC Price: $98.63 \u2013 Bitcoin crosses the $100 barrier for the first time, but panic selling leads to the price rapidly dropping to $68, then rising back to $228 in the second week of April.\nApril 11, 2013, BTC Price: $127.17 \u2013 The Winklevoss twins, also known as Winklevii, arrive on the crypto scene.\nThe twins were the among the first publicly recognizable figures to disclose a large stake in Bitcoin. At the time, they claimed to have an $11 million stash of Bitcoin, for which they paid around $10 per coin.\nCameron Winklevoss said to the New York Times, \u201cpeople really don\u2019t want to take it seriously. At some point that narrative will shift to \u2018virtual currencies are here to stay.\u2019 We\u2019re in the early days.\u201d\nMay 1, 2013, BTC Price: $127.74 \u2013 Celebrated actor Ashton Kutcher tells a crowd at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference that \u201cbitcoins are obviously becoming more and more relevant,\u201dand \u201cthe same infrastructure that built out bitcoin could be used in the security industry for mass good.\u201d\nMay 6, 2013, BTC Price: $114.13 \u2013 Bill Gates calls Bitcoin a \u201ctechno tour de force\u201d during an interview with Fox business. However, Gates later expressed some reservations about crypto\u2019s anonymity.\nCharlie Munger (centre), vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, responds that his belief is that Bitcoin is \u201crat poison.\u201d Warren Buffet (right) plays it safe, saying \u201cI think either Charlie or Bill is right.\u201d\nTo date, Munger has maintained this position. In 2019, he said \u201cI think the whole damn development is disgusting and contrary to the interests of civilization.\u201d\nOctober 13, 2013, BTC Price: $130.20 \u2013 An ATM capable of converting Canadian dollars to Bitcoin opens in a coffee shop in Vancouver, Canada. The ATM required customers to have their palms scanned before they could exchange any Bitcoin.\nNovember 18,19, 2013, BTC Price: $578.41 \u2013 The US Senate Banking Committee holds hearings to discuss the benefits and potential risks of digital assets like Bitcoin. These hearings were among the first to be held by the U.S. government in which Bitcoin has some positive light shone on it.\nThe committee found that Bitcoin had legitimate and beneficial uses such as micro-payments, faster payment settlement time and enhanced security. Naturally, there was much discussion of Bitcoin\u2019s risks, such as providing criminals with an easier avenue for money laundering.\nJennifer Shasky Calvery (pictured below) from the Treasury Department, stated that \u201cwith regard to Bitcoin\u2026it seems that there\u2019s a lot of legitimate users out there and like any type of payment system it can be exploited by illicit actors.\u201d\nCalvery later added, \u201cin some countries there may be an interest in Bitcoin because where you have a home currency that might be considered extremely volatile, Bitcoin might be considered a better place in which to store value.\u201d\nNovember 20, 2013, BTC Price: $567.35 \u2013 A representative of the Chinese government by the name of Wang Yi announces that Chinese citizens can trade Bitcoin.\nThe Financial Times reported that while Beijing hadn\u2019t officially given Bitcoin its blessing, the statement from Yi meant the Chinese government was \u201ccontent to let the market develop.\u201d\nBitcoin\u2019s price surges over the $1,000 mark shortly after Yi\u2019s announcement, reaching another all-time high of $1,156.10 in December.\nDecember 18, 2013, BTC Price: $597.50 \u2013 On the Bitcointalk forum, the infamous HODLING post is shared with the world.\n2014 \u2013 2017\nJanuary 23, 2014, BTC Price: $815.30 \u2013 Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan Chase & CO, describes Bitcoin as a \u201cterrible store of value.\u201d\nFor the six years following this statement, Dimon has maintained this position. As recently as October 11, 2021, Dimon said, \u201cI personally think that Bitcoin is worthless.\"\nFebruary 2014, BTC Price: $808.21 \u2013 One of the largest Bitcoin exchanges, Mt. Gox, collapses. The exchange lost half a billion dollars of customer money. Predictably, many lawsuits were filed, and the price of Bitcoin crashed.\nMt. Gox\u2019s CEO, Mark Karpeles, said the loss wasn\u2019t due to a fault in Bitcoin\u2019s code, but rather his firm\u2019s inadequate security.\nMarch 6, 2014, BTC Price: $669.09 \u2013 Newsweek posts an article claiming to have discovered the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto. And so begins the wild, unpredictable, and unfinished manhunt to find the real Satoshi.\nThe man Newsweek believed to be the real Satoshi was a Japanese American engineer called Dorian Nakamoto. Nakamoto shared a few professional similarities with Satoshi, as well as his last name.\nHowever, the shared surname likely doesn\u2019t mean much. There are an estimated 50,889 people living in Japan with the surname Nakamoto, and a further 2,881 living in the United States.\nTo this day, Dorian Nakamoto denies that he is Satoshi.\nNewsweek initially shared a photo of Nakamoto\u2019s home, which meant that practically anyone could find out where he lived. This prompted a ferocious backlash against Newsweek for its irresponsible reporting.\nA campaign on Reddit later raised 100 Bitcoin for Dorian Nakamoto as a way of apologizing for the stressful ordeal he had been put through.\nMarch 25, 2014, BTC Price: $584.84 \u2013 The U.S. Inland Revenue Service (IRS) declares it will \u201ctreat bitcoins, and similar virtual currencies as property, not currency for U.S. federal tax purposes.\u201d\nOctober 2, 2014, BTC Price: $378.42 \u2013 During an interview with Bloomberg, Bill Gates stays positive on Bitcoin, saying that \u201cBitcoin is better than currency in that you don\u2019t have to be physically in the same place and, of course, for large transactions, currency can get pretty inconvenient.\u201d\nDecember 11, 2014, BTC Price: $346.90 \u2013 Microsoft announces that it will soon begin accepting Bitcoin for Windows operating system keys and hardware products including phones and Xbox consoles.\nOctober 22, 2015, BTC Price: $271.82 \u2013 The EU declares Bitcoin is to be treated as a currency in Europe, meaning European citizens can trade Bitcoin without paying any taxes.\nThe European Court of Justice\u2019s statement said that Bitcoin trades and transactions \u201care exempt from VAT (value-added tax) under the provision concerning transactions relating to currency, bank notes and coins used as legal tender.\u201d\nDecember 8, 2015, BTC Price: $407.74 \u2013 Wired publishes a story suggesting an Australian computer scientist called Craig Wright might be Satoshi Nakamoto.\nDecember 9, 2015, BTC Price: $418.88 \u2013 Craig Wright\u2019s claims to be the real Satoshi begin unravelling faster than they first appeared.\nVice reports that the PGP keys used to \u201cprove\u201d Wright was Satoshi were generated after 2009.

The protests escalate into violent riots reportedly fuelled by country-wide economic inequality, and eventually lead to 277 deaths and at least 10,000 arrests. After four days of rioting, on January 6, President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev blocked all internet access across Kazakhstan, ending Bitcoin mining nation-wide.\nIn a typical year, this wouldn\u2019t have caused much of a problem. However, owing to China\u2019s crypto mining ban, Kazakhstan was at the time saturated with Bitcoin miners. In fact, its share of Bitcoin miners grew from 1.4% in September 2019, before China banned crypto, to 18% when President Tokayev turned the lights off. As such, Bitcoin\u2019s global hashrate fell by 14% during the first two blackout days.\nDuring the three weeks following these protests, Bitcoin\u2019s price dropped from $47,345 to $35,030.\nRead: Bitcoin mining in Kazakhstan.\nFebruary 8, 2022, BTC Price: $44,118.\nThe United States Department of Justice announces it has seized $3.6 billion in stolen Bitcoin from the 2016 Bitfinex hack.

The data suggests that nearly 70% of British crypto owners believe that the FCA regulates crypto, which is not correct. The FCA only regulates crypto-related advertising, not tradeable cryptocurrencies themselves.\nFebruary 24, 2022, BTC Price: $38,332.\nRussia launches a full-scale assault on Ukraine, pressing fast towards the cities of Kyiv, Kharkiv and Kherson. Russian civilian aircraft are banned from EU airspace, and Russian state-owned media are banned from EU airwaves. Before long, the Russian government threatens to shut off gas supplies to the EU, which quickly sends energy prices \u2013 and Bitcoin mining costs \u2013 to the moon.\nTwo days after the invasion, the Ukrainian government called for cryptocurrency donations on Twitter. More than $50 million is raised within the first three weeks of conflict, and by the third week of March that figure grows to nearly $100 million. The funds go to the Ukrainian government and an NGO called Come Back Alive, which also supports the Ukrainian military.\nRussia is quickly barred from SWIFT, which stops its banks interacting with the global financial system. Questions then arise about whether Russian citizens could use cryptocurrency to circumvent sanctions. In an effort to prevent this, EU and US leadership asked crypto exchanges to freeze any accounts known to belong to Russians. The exchanges, for the most part, refuse. They release statements explaining that unilaterally banning all Russian users would \u201cfly in the face of the reason why crypto exists.\u201d\nCoinbase\u2019s statement says, \u201cAt this time, we will not institute a blanket ban on all Coinbase transactions involving Russian addresses. Instead, we will continue to implement all sanctions that have been imposed, including blocking accounts and transactions that may involve sanctioned individuals or entities.\u201d\nBinance releases a similar statement, in which CZ explains that Binance wouldn\u2019t ban users from one country because \u201cwe don\u2019t think we have the authority to do so.\u201d\nKraken CEO Jesse Powell goes further than Coinbase and Binance, arguing the US government had no right to ask his company to freeze Russian accounts: \u201cif we were going to voluntarily freeze financial accounts of residents of countries unjustly attacking and provoking violence around the world, step 1 would be to freeze all U.S. accounts.\u201d\nOne exchange does comply with the requests; a Ukrainian NFT exchange called DMarket. DMarket freezes accounts registered to Russian and Belarusian citizens, and later prevents people from either country from opening accounts on the site.\nBitcoin\u2019s price plummets from $44,000 the week before Russia invades to $34,000 by the end of February.\nMarch 9, 2022, BTC Price: $41,982.\nPresident Biden signs an executive order titled \u201cEnsuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets.\u201d The order broadly lays out a road map for the US government\u2019s plans for using and regulating cryptocurrencies.\nThe order lays out various policy statements related to crypto, such as \u201cwe must protect consumers, investors, and businesses in the United States,\u201d and, \u201cwe must support technological advances that promote responsible development and use of digital assets.\u201d\nA series of reports from US Government agencies on the creation and use of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are also requested, as well as reports from the Treasury about policy recommendations related to crypto. As part of the reports, the US government will consult with the numerous financial regulators on how best to protect consumers from crypto-related risks.\nOne of the order\u2019s notable objectives is to \u201cmitigate the illicit finance and national security risk posed by misuse of digital assets.\u201d This objective likely pertains to Russia\u2019s recent invasion of Ukraine and specific concerns about the Russian state (including senior Russian government officials) avoiding financial sanctions using crypto.\nFollowing the executive order, Bitcoin surged 9% as crypto execs reacted favourably to the bill.\nApril 27, 2022, BTC Price: $39,241.\nLawmakers from the Central African Republic (CAR) voted unanimously to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, making it the second country to do so, after El Salvador.\nFollowing the legislation\u2019s passing, CAR citizens can use the CFA Franc and Bitcoin for all their day-to-day spending.

Its eventual crash will likely be remembered as one of the most spectacular collapses in crypto history, and the repercussions will be felt for years.\nRead: A full breakdown of the Terra crash.\nTerra is chiefly known for its algorithmic stablecoin, UST, which was pegged to $1 using a companion token called Luna. Unlike other stablecoins (like USDC), Terra doesn\u2019t store cash in reserve to support its price peg. Instead, the protocol automatically executes swaps to maintain UST\u2019s price peg based on supply and demand. Well, that was the idea anyway.\nOn the morning of May 7, a LUNA whale swaps $85 million UST for USDC, which leads many people to speculate that UST might slip from its $1 peg, which would spell disaster for the Terra network. On May 9, this fear became a reality as UST unpegs, dropping from $1 to $0.35.\nLuna, Terra\u2019s companion token once worth $120, falls by 96% within twenty-four hours, including a 32% drop in just one hour. It is now worth fractions of a penny. The Terra blockchain halted, meanwhile crypto investors scramble to cut their losses: DeFi DApps witnessed $28 billion wiped from their protocols within just a few weeks.\nBitcoin\u2019s price dropped from $35,501 to $28,900 during the peak fallout.\nThe Terra network\u2019s implosion caused an earthquake in crypto that saw the global crypto market cap more than halve from $1.8 trillion in early May to $822 billion by the middle of June. A venture fund called Hashed reportedly lost $3.5 billion from Terra\u2019s collapse, although the damage wasn\u2019t limited to just one firm. Several crypto platforms and venture capital firms would later become collateral casualties, most notably Celsius and 3AC.\nJune 12, 2022, BTC Price: $26,762.\nThe Celsius network announces it has frozen customer withdrawals, swaps and transfers in response to \u201cextreme market conditions\u201d following Terra\u2019s collapse. Rumours then spread that the firm has secretly slipped into insolvency and is trying to make off with its customers\u2019 cash.\nBitcoin\u2019s price sank by 12% the following day.\nCelsius users erupted into a furious rage following the announcement, with most criticising the platform for taking their money hostage and leaving them in the dark. The company refuses to offer any timeline for when its 1.7 million clients could withdraw or transfer their funds. A short while later, the global crypto markets dipped below $1 trillion for the first time since January 2021.\nTwo weeks after the announcement, in early July, Celsius laid off one in five of its employees and hired a team of restructuring experts, causing the rumour mill to spin even faster.\nAfter two more weeks of speculation, Celsius\u2019 users\u2019 worst fears are finally realised: Celsius officially files for bankruptcy. The firm\u2019s filings attempted to explain why it froze customer funds: \u201cWithout a pause, the acceleration of withdrawals would have allowed certain customers \u2013 those who were first to act \u2013 to be paid in full while leaving others behind to wait for Celsius to harvest value from illiquid or longer-term asset deployment activities before they receive a recovery.\u201d\nWhile this is of course true, many users quickly point out this doesn\u2019t explain why their funds had to be frozen in the first place, or why the firm is filing for bankruptcy.\nA court filing in the days that followed revealed a $1.3 billion hole in Celsius\u2019 balance sheet, and that its users were owed at least $4.7 billion. The firm blames its extraordinary liquidity shortage on a domino effect starting from Terra\u2019s collapse during early May.\nRead: A review of the Celsius network halt.\nJune 15, 2022, BTC Price: $22,572\nRumours emerge that a highly respected venture capital firm called Three Arrows Capital (3AC), which once managed $18 billion in assets at its peak, has become the latest casualty of the crypto crash set off by Terra\u2019s collapse.\nSpeculation begins after Su Zhu, one of the firm\u2019s founders, tweets:\n\n\u201cWe are in the process of communicating with relevant parties and fully committed to working this out.\u201d\n\nRather than clarify the situation, this tweet suggests the firm is in big trouble without explaining exactly what\u2019s going on, how much capital is at risk, and who might be affected. However, one point seemed clear at the time: the earlier collapse of Celsius and Terra probably had something to do with 3AC\u2019s crisis.\nAt the time of Terra\u2019s collapse, 3AC\u2019s founders \u2014 Kyle Davies and Su Zhu \u2014 assured their investors that the crash wouldn\u2019t affect their firm. This assurance was unfortunately untrue, as it later emerged that 3AC had borrowed billions of dollars from platforms like Celsius, Genesis and more to invest in Terra, including swapping $500 million in Bitcoin for an equivalent sum of Luna \u2014 Terra\u2019s now nearly worthless governance token.\nWhen LUNA crashed, this $500 million investment practically vanished into thin air. As such, 3AC was circling the drain, but their investors were none the wiser.\nA few days after Zhu\u2019s Tweet, the WSJ reports that 3AC might not be able to repay its $665 million loan from Voyager Digital, a firm which subsequently files for bankruptcy as a direct result of this unpaid loan. Zhu promptly removes all references to crypto from his Twitter bio, other than Bitcoin, and deletes his Instagram account.\nIt later emerges that when 3AC was facing dozens of margin calls, Zhu, Davies and their staff were desperately betting their clients\u2019 money in a vain attempt to claw back the cash they had secretly lost.\nBitcoin, which started June hovering at $32,000 or so, nosedived to $18,000 during the peak of 3AC\u2019s collapse. While other factors certainly influenced Bitcoin\u2019s price, 3AC\u2019s demise undoubtedly played a significant role in Bitcoin dipping below $20,000 for the first time since 2020.\nOn June 29, two weeks after Zhu\u2019s Tweet, a court in the British Virgin Islands ordered 3AC to liquidate its assets. And on July 1, the firm officially filed for bankruptcy in a New York court, without Zhu or Davies present. Bankruptcy documents reveal 3AC owes at least $3 billion to its creditors.\nDespite Zhu and Davies disappearing from public life, they both submitted financial claims against their own firm as part of the bankruptcy filings: Zhu for $5 million and Davies\u2019 wife for $65.7 million. The good people of Twitter mercilessly ridicule the founders for disappearing and refusing to explain how they bankrupted their firm, while simultaneously filing court documents to pursue claims against their own penniless company. This leads a US court to freeze the founders\u2019 assets, citing their near-total lack of communication with their creditors as a cause.\n3AC\u2019s once bustling Singapore offices are visited by court-appointed liquidators in mid-July, who find them empty and abandoned, with nothing but old mail left behind. US liquidators spoke with 3AC\u2019s creditors, including Genesis Trading, Deribit, BitMEX, BlockFi, Celsius, Voyager Digital and Blockchain.com, all of which are owed large sums by 3AC.\nIt's not readily apparent how 3AC so suddenly imploded, but one theory posits the firm was both over leveraged and long on all its investments at a time when the crypto market was rapidly crashing. This, combined with its massive bet on Terra, caused a firm that was once revered and respected to dramatically crash and burn, and its founders to flee from public life in disgrace.\nRead: 3AC: The fall of the crypto hedge fund behemoth.\nJune 17, 2022, Bitcoin Price: $20,381.\nWhile Bitcoin sank to its lowest price in eighteen months, the UK\u2019s financial regulator (FCA) reports that 78% of British adults had heard of crypto, and that 4.4% owned at least one cryptocurrency, up from 3.9% the previous year. The FCA also reveals the average Brit holds $361 in crypto, up from $310 the year before.\nJuly 20, 2022, Bitcoin Price: $24,169.\nA spokesperson from Tesla reveals that the firm has sold 75% of its Bitcoin holdings for roughly $900 million. The electric car manufacturer states that \u201cBitcoin impairment\u201d had negatively affected its quarterly earnings, hence the sale. This decision obviously did not bode well for Bitcoin maxis.\nThe move follows Tesla\u2019s founder Elon Musk\u2019s change of heart on Bitcoin back in May, when he suggested that while \u201ccryptocurrency is a good idea on many levels\u2026this cannot come at great cost to the environment.\u201d Following this earlier announcement, Tesla stopped accepting Bitcoin payments for its electric vehicles.\nThis article contains links to third-party websites or other content for information purposes only (\u201cThird-Party Sites\u201d).

But there was at least one exchange established in the first year since Bitcoin's inception.\nThe BitcoinTalk forum went online in late 2009 and soon enough one regular proposed the idea of an exchange where people could buy and sell Bitcoins for fiat currency. Keep in mind that this was when the block reward was 50 BTC and there were very few people mining.\nThe BitcoinTalk forum member NewLibertyStandard set up New Liberty Standard Exchange, and another forum user - Sirius - sent him 5050 BTC in exchange for $5.02 through PayPal. This puts the first recorded price at which Bitcoin exchanged hands at $0.00099/BTC.\nHow Much was 1 Bitcoin Worth in 2010?\nBitcoin's price never topped $1 in 2010! Its highest price for the year was just $0.39!\n2010 is the year in which the famous purchase of two Dominos pizzas for 10,000 BTC took place.\nBitcoinTalk forum member laszlo offered the following trade:\nI'll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas.. like maybe 2 large ones so I have some left over for the next day. I like having left over pizza to nibble on later. You can make the pizza yourself and bring it to my house or order it for me from a delivery place, but what I'm aiming for is getting food delivered in exchange for bitcoins where I don't have to order or prepare it myself, kind of like ordering a 'breakfast platter' at a hotel or something, they just bring you something to eat and you're happy!\nI like things like onions, peppers, sausage, mushrooms, tomatoes, pepperoni, etc.. just standard stuff no weird fish topping or anything like that. I also like regular cheese pizzas which may be cheaper to prepare or otherwise acquire.\nIf you're interested please let me know and we can work out a deal.\nThanks,\nLaszlo\nBitcoinTalk Forum(1)\n2010 also saw the opening of the infamous Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox in July.\nHow Much was 1 Bitcoin Worth in 2011?\n\nBitcoin Price during 2011\nBitcoin's adoption started to pick up steam in 2011. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) accepted Bitcoins as donations for a couple of months in 2011. Due to lack of legal precedent surrounding virtual currencies this arrangement was quickly rescinded, though this was later reversed in 2013 when the EFF began accepting Bitcoin again.\nOn February 9th, 2011, BTC reached a value of USD$1.00 for the first time ever. A few months later, in June, the price of one Bitcoin hit $10, then $30 on Mt. Gox. This represented a 100x appreciation since the beginning of the year, when the price of Bitcoin hovered around $0.30.\nBy the end of the year Bitcoin was trading just under $5, but at least two important psychological barriers had been broken.\nHow Much was 1 Bitcoin Worth in 2012?\n\nBitcoin Price during 2012\nBitcoin had a relatively flat 2012, trading within a $0.50 range of $5.00 for the first half of the year.\nIt then reached its yearly peak at the end of December, hitting a high of $13.45.\nIn November 2012, Bitcoin underwent its first ever halving. This dropped the block reward from 50 BTC to 25 BTC.\n2012 also saw the creation of the influential Bitcoin Foundation by Gavin Andresen, Jon Matonis, Patrick Murck, Charlie Shrem, and Peter Vessenes. The Foundation's goal is to \"accelerate the global growth of Bitcoin through standardization, protection, and promotion of the open source protocol\".\nWordpress became the first major company to begin in 2012(2). The online content management system provider did this in response to PayPal's censorship.\nPayPal alone blocks access from over 60 countries, and many credit card companies have similar restrictions. Some are blocked for political reasons, some because of higher fraud rates, and some for other financial reasons. Whatever the reason, we don\u2019t think an individual blogger from Haiti, Ethiopia, or Kenya should have diminished access to the blogosphere because of payment issues they can\u2019t control. Our goal is to enable people, not block them.\u201d\nWordpress(3)\nThough Wordpress's move was a big one for the four year-old cryptocurrency, the company wasn't handling Bitcoin transactions itself. Rather, it used BitPay, which was founded in 2011 and by October 2012 had grown to processing Bitcoin payments for more than 1,000 merchants.\nHow Much was 1 Bitcoin Worth in 2013?\n\nBitcoin Price during 2013\n2013 saw the first major spike in the price of Bitcoin since 2011. From $13.00 at the beginning of the year, Bitcoin hit nearly $250 in April. It then cooled off for a while, before experiencing another rapid appreciation to over $1,100 in December of that year.\nBitcoin punched through $100 easily, though $1,000 proved to be a tougher psychological resistance level. Despite reaching prices that early Bitcoiners had only ever dreamed about, it took more than three years for the price to reach $1,000 again. The drawdown reached -85% at its bottom and the price of Bitcoin was relatively flat for years.\nBitcoin's record-breaking run pushed the cryptocurrency's market capitalization over $1 billion for the first time ever. It also attracted a lot of attention. In February of 2013, Coinbase reported selling more than $1 million worth of Bitcoin at an average price of $22.\nThe world's first Bitcoin ATM was installed in Vancouver, allowing people to turn their cash into crypto.\nThe internet's first cryptocurrency also gained some notoriety after the People's Bank of China prohibited Chinese financial institutions from transacting in Bitcoins. This came in December 2013 and led to the shutdown of BTC China - at that time the world's largest Bitcoin exchanges - and a sudden drop in price.\nHow Much was 1 Bitcoin Worth in 2014?\n\nBitcoin Price during 2014\n2014 got off to a good start, but things quickly turned sour for Bitcoin.\nJust one month after it closed, BTC China reopened for trading and Chinese Yuan deposits in January 2014.\nHowever, in February Mt. Gox \u2013 still one of the largest and most important crypto exchanges \u2013 suspended withdrawals. Users had been reporting issues with withdrawals for months, but the exchange called it quits once and for all and filed for bankruptcy. It also reported that it had lost 744,000 BTC of user funds.\nThe price of Bitcoin reacted by selling off more than 55% from the beginning of February to April.\nDespite the bear market, a number of big companies announced their support for Bitcoin. Overstock.com began accepting Bitcoin for all purchases on its website, as did Microsoft in the Xbox and Windows stores.\nHow Much was 1 Bitcoin Worth in 2015?\n\nBitcoin Price during 2015\nThe price of Bitcoin in 2015 started off weakly, with a -50% selloff in the first two weeks of the year. This included a -24% drop in just one day on the 14th of January. This may have been inspired by the announcement from prominent European exchange Bitstamp that they had lost 19,000 BTC in a hack. Coinbase had better news, though, as the exchange raised $75 million in its Series C funding round.\n$150 marked the local bottom for the year, though. In fact, January 2015 was the last time you could ever buy 1 BTC for $150. The price of Bitcoin topped $500 for the first time in over a year later in 2015.\nIn June, the New York State Department of Financial Services began its investigation into Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. This investigation would eventually lead to the creation of the BitLicense.\nIn November, the Unicode Committee adopted the current Bitcoin currency symbol (\u20bf), giving the internet's first widespread native currency its own character.\nHow Much was 1 Bitcoin Worth in 2016?\n\nBitcoin Price during 2016\n2016 saw the Bitcoin network's hash rate top 1 exahash/second. The hash rate reflects the amount of computing power committed to Bitcoin and is an important measure of the strength of the network.\nThe price of Bitcoin continued its slow but steady appreciation over the course of the year. After a spike to $750 in June, Bitcoin retraced before closing the year just shy of the all-important $1,000 mark.\nHow Much was 1 Bitcoin Worth in 2017?\n\nBitcoin Price during 2017\n2017 is a year that lives in crypto history. As you can see in the chart above, the year saw a steady appreciation in the price of Bitcoin followed by a huge blow-off top to nearly $20,000.\nThis 1,300% increase in price wasn't the largest yearly growth \u2013 that title belongs to 2013 with its 6,600% gains \u2013 but it was the first time that Bitcoin truly broke into the mainstream of public opinion.\nA $19,000 Bitcoin is impossible to ignore.\nBitcoin once again broke the $1,000 resistance on January 1st for the first time in three years, and after the 28th of March it never revisited that level.\nThe massive appreciation in price over the course of 2017 was driven in part by strong retail interest in the cryptocurrency. Trading volume on Bitso - Mexico's leading exchange - grew 1,500% in the six months ending March 2017. Poloniex experienced 600% growth in the number of active traders on its platform throughout the year.\nDespite the huge increase in price and subsequent attention paid to Bitcoin, 2017 was not without difficulty for the cryptocurrency. This was the year of one of the most contentious and hotly-debated events in Bitcoin history: the Bitcoin Cash hard fork.\nWhile many were concerned about the effects of this fork on Bitcoin, with the benefit of four years' hindsight its safe to say that Bitcoin Cash lost the war it started. Today, its market capitalization is less than 1% of Bitcoin's.\nOn December 11, Bitcoin futures trading opened at the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the largest U.S. options exchange. Bitcoin rallied 12% that day, though its stellar run came to an end just five days later. The high of $19,000 would not be broken for almost three more years.\nHow Much was 1 Bitcoin Worth in 2018?\n\nBitcoin Price during 2018\n2018 was a tough year for many in Bitcoin, both seasoned investors and those new to the space who had been attracted by the hype of 2017.\nBitcoin's year-on-year (YoY) return for 2018 was a painful -73%.\nGoogle, Twitter and Facebook all passed bans on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency advertisements on their platforms, with the latter claiming that they were \"frequently associated with misleading or deceptive promotional practices.\"\nBitcoin closed 2018 at $3,693 \u2013 more than $10,000 down from where it ended the previous year.\nThe good news for investors (though they wouldn't know it just yet) was that the bottom of Bitcoin's bear market had come on December 15, when the price hit $3,122.\nHow Much was 1 Bitcoin Worth in 2019?\n\nBitcoin Price during 2019\n2019 was a rollercoaster ride for Bitcoin hodlers. Starting the year under $4,000, the price of Bitcoin rose nearly $10,000 to hit $13,880 by the middle of the year.\nYet these gains did not prove to be sustainable. Bitcoin bled out over the next six months, a handful of pumps notwithstanding, and ended up closing the year around $7,160.\nStill, the bounce from $3,500 to $13,500 proved that Bitcoin was not dead, despite the naysayers of the 2018 bear market.\n2019 set the stage for what would prove to be one of the most extreme years in Bitcoin's history: 2020.\nHow Much was 1 Bitcoin Worth in 2020?\n\nBitcoin Price during 2020\nBitcoin rose strongly from $7,000 at the beginning of the year to more than $10,000 in mid-February.\n$10,000 proved to be a critical level for Bitcoin throughout the year, though it would take until October for the price to leave the $10,000s once and for all.\nFirst came the March crash. Triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic, a global liquidity event, and exchange liquidation engines run amok, Bitcoin sold off nearly 40% on March 12. It hit a low of $3,850 before doubling in price over the next six weeks.\nBitcoin then entered a months-long accumulation pattern, before charging above $10,000 in late July. It hit a high of over $12,000 before dumping back to below $10,000 in early September.\nThis proved to be the final fakeout, though. From September to the end of the year, the price of Bitcoin rallied 185% to close at just under $29,000. This was more than $10,000 above the previous all time high set in 2017.\nFrom the agonizing March crash to the parabolic move into the end of the year, 2020 was a year of extreme highs and lows for Bitcoin.\nThis was driven in part by institutional investment. MicroStrategy's purchase of more than $1 billion worth of Bitcoin at an average price of $15,964 over the course of 2020 made headlines. So did the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company, spending more than $100 million on Bitcoin. This was a watershed moment for the cryptocurrency, as insurance companies are known to be conservative in their investments.\n2020 proved that Bitcoin can bounce back strongly from major global events. In fact, it may even be stronger as a result. Many investors are looking to Bitcoin as a safe store of value in the face of unprecedented money printing in many countries.\nWhile it's impossible to tell the future, one thing is for sure: 2021 is shaping up to be just as important a year in the history of Bitcoin.\nHow Much was 1 Bitcoin Worth in 2021?\n\nBitcoin Price during 2021\nStarting the year just below the $30,000 mark, Bitcoin experienced a significant rally in the first half, reaching its peak close to $60,000 around April.\nHowever, post-April, the cryptocurrency faced a decline, stabilizing around the $40,000 mark by July.\nThe remainder of the year showcased a consistent upward trajectory, with a few fluctuations but maintaining its value above the $50,000 mark for a significant duration.\nThe year ended with Bitcoin slightly retracing from its high but still showcasing an overall upward trend from the start of the year.\nHow Much was 1 Bitcoin Worth in 2022?\n\nBitcoin Price during 2022\nThe year 2022 saw a tumultuous start for Bitcoin. Beginning near the $50,000 mark in January, it experienced a steady decline through the initial months, reaching its lowest point around the $30,000 range in May.\nAfter May, the cryptocurrency did not recover significantly past this point. The price stabilized, hovering between $20,000 to $30,000 for the rest of the year.\nThere were moments of slight upward movements, but they were met with subsequent declines, maintaining Bitcoin's price within this bracket. The year witnessed a notable constriction in its price volatility, especially when contrasted with previous years.\nHow Much is Bitcoin Worth in Gold\nYou can check the Bitcoin price in gold, by clicking here.\n \nFAQ\nHow Much Was Bitcoin When it First Came Out?\nBitcoin did not have a price when it first came out.\nBitcoin was much different than the ICOs we've come to know in nowadays.\nBitcoin was just a passion project created by Satoshi Nakamoto and his online cypherpunk friends.\nEveryone back then acquired Bitcoins by mining them on their personal computer and trading them with each other just to see if they could.\nIt really wasn't until Laszlo Hanyecz made the first Bitcoin trade for real goods (two Papa John's pizzas in exchange for 10,000 Bitcoins) that there was really even a price applied to Bitcoin at all.\nWhat was The Bitcoin Price 10 Years Ago?\nBitcoin hit $1 for the first time ever on February 9th, 2011. On that day, forums posts began to emerge suggesting Bitcoiners around the world ought to throw \"parity parties\" (meaning a party celebrating Bitcoin's parity with the US Dollar).\nWhat Was Bitcoin's Lowest Price Ever?\nTechnically, the lowest Bitcoin price ever was $0.00. That's because for many years, Bitcoins weren't worth anything.\nBitcoins lowest price after its all time high in 2017 was around $3,350.\nHow Much is a Share of Bitcoin\nWe don't really call anything in Bitcoin a \"share\". This is a term we generally use for stocks issued on a stock exchange. Bitcoin doesn't really work that way. All there is is the Bitcoin Price.\nCurrently the price of a Bitcoin (or a \"share of Bitcoin\", if you'd like) is displayed at the top of this page and is updated regularly.\nWhy did Bitcoin Break its All Time High on February 23, 2017?\nBefore February 23, 2017, Bitcoin had experienced 2 years of downwards price action followed by about 2 years of upwards movement. Once it got close to its previous high, it busted through and continued to run up throughout all of 2017.\nWhy did Bitcoin Break its All Time High on November 5, 2013?\nThis was a wave driven by hype and greed. People had heard about Bitcoin throughout 2013, but never acted. On its second run, many people finally took the dive and started to get interested.\nWhy did Bitcoin Break its All Time High on February 20, 2013\nMany believe that Cyprus's financial crisis(4) helped create new demand for bitcoins.\nWhen Will Bitcoin Hit a New All Time High Again?\nNobody knows for sure! One trend to notice is that Bitcoin's supply halving have often preceded its historic runs.\nWill Bitcoin Ever Hit a New High Again?\nAgain, nobody knows for sure!\nBitcoin's price has always moved in cycles.

      "content": "Bitcoin Price History in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 & Beyond\n\nBitcoin\u2019s beginnings go back to 2009, which means it\u2019s been around for 15 years. Imagine buying Bitcoin for a fraction of a cent back then, only to see it skyrocket to tens of thousands of dollars in the years that followed, with the current price over $60,000.\n\nLet\u2019s take a journey through the key milestones in Bitcoin\u2019s price evolution, year by year, and uncover the factors that drove its dramatic fluctuations. We are going to examine Bitcoin\u2019s eventful past and highlight the most important events and developments in its 15-year history.\n\nKey takeaways:\n\nWhat was the price of Bitcoin in 2009?\n\nBitcoin\u2019s journey began in 2009 with an initial value of effectively $0, as it hadn\u2019t yet been traded on exchanges. You might be wondering what the first \u201cabove zero\u201d price of Bitcoin was in 2009.\n\nWell, the first recorded market price for Bitcoin occurred in October 2009, when it was valued at about $0.00099 per coin for a small transaction. Just for perspective\u2019s sake, if you had invested only $10 in Bitcoin back then and kept it until now, that investment would now be worth around $5 million.\n\nIn Bitcoin\u2019s early years, there was minimal public awareness of it and there was very little trading involved. In fact, the first real-world transaction didn\u2019t happen until May 2010, which we will talk about in the next section.\n\nWhat was the price of Bitcoin in 2010?\n\nIn 2010, the price of Bitcoin began to show signs of life, starting the year at approximately $0.0008 and demonstrating noteworthy early volatility.\n\nFor most of 2010, Bitcoin traded under $0.10, with its price peaking at $0.39 in early November 2010. This marked a notable increase from its starting value earlier in the year. By the end of 2010, Bitcoin closed the year at about $0.30, which was a remarkable increase of approximately 500% since the beginning of the year.\n\nOne of the most notable events in 2010 was the first real-world transaction, where 10,000 Bitcoins were used to purchase two pizzas, effectively pricing Bitcoin at $0.0025 each at that time. This transaction highlighted Bitcoin\u2019s potential as a medium of exchange and marked an early step toward broader adoption.\n\nThroughout 2010, Bitcoin\u2019s price fluctuated considerably. It was a reflection of the asset\u2019s speculative nature during its early days. The price movements of Bitcoin in 2010 laid the groundwork for its future growth and the increasing interest in this digital currency.\n\nWhat was the price of Bitcoin in 2011?\n\nThe year 2011 was a vital moment for Bitcoin, as it experienced its first major rally. You see, Bitcoin\u2019s price history in 2011 began with a value of around $0.30 and ended the year at approximately $5.27. Throughout the year, Bitcoin\u2019s price was characterized by significant volatility, including fluctuations between $0.30 and $30.\n\nThe price surged to a peak of about $29.60 in June 2011, marking a substantial increase from its starting point. This volatility was influenced by various factors, including market sentiment and regulatory shifts.\n\nAs Bitcoin gained wider attention beyond early adopters, its market cap increased substantially. This, in turn, prompted more public and media interest in the cryptocurrency. This increased visibility contributed to Bitcoin\u2019s price surge in 2011.\n\nThe year witnessed notable price fluctuations, reflecting the inherent volatility of cryptocurrency markets. Despite the fluctuations, Bitcoin\u2019s price history in 2011 laid the groundwork for its future growth and adoption.\n\nWhat was the price of Bitcoin in 2012?\n\nFrom the significant price fluctuations of 2011, where Bitcoin\u2019s value surged to a peak of about $29.60 in June and ended the year at approximately $5.27, we move to the following year, which saw a different trend.\n\nIn 2012, Bitcoin\u2019s price started the year at approximately $5.27 and ended at around $13.30. This was a growth of about 152% over the year, which would be considered astronomical in any market that isn\u2019t crypto.\n\nThis price increase was influenced by the first Bitcoin halving event in November 2012, which reduced mining rewards from 50 BTC to 25 BTC.\n\nThroughout 2012, Bitcoin experienced fluctuations between approximately $4 and $16 as it gained traction among early adopters and investors.\n\nWhat was the price of Bitcoin in 2013?\n\n2013 was an absolutely pivotal year for Bitcoin. Its price skyrocketed from around $13 to a peak of approximately $1,100 in December. This was an astonishing increase of over 8,800% within the year, a truly ludicrous amount even by crypto standards.\n\nThis significant growth was partly due to increased media exposure and the rise of cryptocurrency exchanges, which contributed to Bitcoin\u2019s market popularity surge.\n\nBy the end of April, Bitcoin\u2019s price had surpassed $200, and by December, the price hit the peak of $1,100. The year ended with Bitcoin closing at around $730 after experiencing substantial volatility throughout the year.\n\nThe price movements in 2013 were heavily influenced by several events, including the shutdown of the Silk Road marketplace and growing interest from both retail and institutional investors.\n\nAs part of Bitcoin\u2019s price history, 2013 stands out as a year of remarkable growth and increased recognition in the financial and technological communities. Arguably, this was the first time the term Bitcoin was starting to be ushered by regular people who aren\u2019t investors or finance professionals.\n\nWhat was the price of Bitcoin in 2014-2015?\n\nThe years 2014-2015 are mostly a part of Bitcoin\u2019s story that shows resilience and gradual recovery.\n\nIn 2014, Bitcoin\u2019s price started at approximately $770 but fell considerably throughout the year, ending around $315. This decline was largely due to the Mt. Gox exchange hack and increased regulatory scrutiny.\n\nThe price fluctuation in 2014 saw Bitcoin dip to a low of about $200 before initiating a small recovery towards year-end.\n\nAt the end of 2015, Bitcoin\u2019s price closed out at around $425, a significant decrease from the highs of 2013, but still much higher than where it first started.\n\nWhat was the price of Bitcoin in 2016-2017?\n\nIn 2016, we saw the price of Bitcoin grow steadily throughout the year. It starts at around $430 and closes at approximately $960. Unlike previous increases in price, 2016 was quite tame by Bitcoin\u2019s standards, without much in the way of volatility that crypto is known for.\n\nThis steady growth was a reflection of increasing confidence in Bitcoin\u2019s potential and improving market conditions.\n\nIn 2017, Bitcoin\u2019s price history took a dramatic turn.\n\nBy January, the price had surpassed $1,000, a significant psychological milestone. The year witnessed a massive bull run, with Bitcoin soaring to nearly $20,000 by December 2017. This surge was fueled by rising public interest, media coverage, and increased investment, both institutional and retail.\n\nThe dramatic price swings during this period also reflected expansion into alternative cryptocurrencies, and it is at this point that the term \u201caltcoins\u201d started to be more widely used.\n\n2017 was a perfect example of the aggressive volatility of Bitcoin.\n\nWhat was the price of Bitcoin in 2018-2023?\n\nBy 2018, Bitcoin\u2019s price was near $13,880 but saw a significant decline to around $3,200 by December, marking a drop of nearly 77%. The following year, Bitcoin recovered some ground, fluctuating between $3,200 and $14,000 before closing at approximately $7,200.\n\nIn 2020, Bitcoin\u2019s price surged dramatically, driven by increased institutional interest and a favorable macroeconomic environment, ending the year at around $28,993, which was a 416% increase from the beginning of the year.\n\nIt reached new all-time highs in 2021, peaking at around $69,000 in November before experiencing notable corrections, ultimately closing at around $46,200.\n\n2022 and 2023 have, for the most part, not been great for Bitcoin\u2019s price. For the better part of those 24 months, the price was oscillating between $16,000 and $40,000, roughly. However, towards the end of 2023, specifically in November and December, the price finally started gaining upwards momentum and broke above $40,000.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price in 2024 so far\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price in the first 3 months of 2024 has seen significant increases and even broke the previous all time high in March, setting a new ATH of around $73,000.\n\nThe second and third quarter have not been as impressive, though it\u2019s been far from disappointing either. The price has been ranging between $57,000 and $71,000. As of August 2024, the time of writing this, the current price of Bitcoin is around $64,000, right in the range we\u2019ve seen for the last 6 months.\n\nThis early surge in 2024 can be attributed to the continued growth of institutional interest and regulatory changes that have positively impacted the market. The peak itself was likely influenced by the approval of several spot Bitcoin ETFs early in the year, which has helped to boost investor confidence and drive up demand.\n\nAlso, the aftermath of the banking crisis in early 2023 saw Bitcoin experience a notable rebound, climbing from around $28,038 to its current levels in 2024. Despite its volatility, 2024 has been characterized by steady growth and significant milestones in Bitcoin\u2019s journey, and will likely be remembered in history as the first time Bitcoin spot ETFs were approved.\n\nMany analysts predict that 2024 will be the year that will finally see BTC break the six-figure mark \u2013 if you want to check algorithmically generated forecasts, make sure to check out our Bitcoin price prediction.\n\nThe bottom line: Bitcoin started at less than a tenth of a cent, now comfortably above $60k\n\nYou\u2019ve seen Bitcoin\u2019s price history, from its negligible value in 2009 to its meteoric rise over the years. In 2010, it peaked at $0.39, then hit $30 in mid-2011. The price has continued to fluctuate, reaching above $1,100 in 2013, dropping, and then growing again to almost $20,000 through 2016-2018.\n\nDespite volatility, Bitcoin has shown steady growth, with its price continuing to rise through 2024 and (very likely) beyond.\n\nPrevious PostHow to Fix \u201cSwap Failed\u201d on Uniswap\n\nNext PostHow to Find New Meme Coins Early in 2024?\n\nRelated Posts\n\nWill Solana Overtake Ethereum in 2025?
